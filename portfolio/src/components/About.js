        Hello, my name is James Dong and I am a rising junior Computer Science
        student at the University of Texas at Austin. My interest computer science
        mostly developed when I was working in a microbiology lab and I was writing
        scripts to analyze DNA sequences. From this experience I realized that 
        computer science was an open ended medium that kept many opportunities
        in different fields of study open to me. I would not be 100% confined to
        a single career path. Fortunately for me, I have been given the opportunity
        to continue my studies at the University of Texas at Austin and I am able
        to pursue my passions.
